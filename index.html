          <p>
            When I was a child i loved to ride a skateboard or a scooter.. I was
            dreaming there about my car in the future, but i need to wait much
            time to my this. One day, I have been on the holidays at ≈Åeba. I was
            walking on the street which is next to the beach, when I saw many
            go-karts. You can rent them if you have eighteen years old or
            someone adult is with you. I remember that I went fast to my parents
            and told them about it. Then I came back with one of them and bought
            one hour to drive this amazing ,,car". It was great! I felt like I
            really drove a car, because in fact, I didnt know how real cars
            work. In next years when I was near the sea I always went to
            go-karts and tryied many of them. Now, When I have a real car and
            know how it work, I can say that is too diffrent hah.. but I dont
            change opinion about go-karts. They are great and I always drive
            them when I am near the sea.
